"""
Monitors the macOS clipboard and fixes an issue where copying images from
Safari also includes the source URL, which can cause problems when pasting
into certain applications.

If an image (TIFF/PNG) and a URL (plain text) are detected simultaneously
on the clipboard (and it's not a file path), the script clears the clipboard
and re-copies *only* the image data.
